ESX is short for EssentialMode Extended. The to-go framework for creating an economy based roleplay server on FiveM and most popular on the platform, too! ESX was initially developed by Gizz back in 2017 for his friend as the were creating an FiveM server and there wasn't any economy roleplaying frameworks available. The original code was written within a week or two and later open sourced, it has ever since been improved and parts been rewritten to further improve on it. Links FiveM Forum Thread (coming soon!) ESX Migration Guide (coming soon!) FiveM Native Reference Requirements A fully configured installation of mysql-async (or equivalent) Features Weight based inventory system Weapons support, including support for attachments and tints Supports different money accounts (defaulted with cash, bank and black money) Many official resources available in our GitHub Job system, with grades and clothes support Supports multiple languages, most strings are localized Easy to use API for developers to easily integrate EX to their projects Register your own commands easily, with argument validation, chat suggestion and using FXServer ACL Exclusive Features We have made some exclusive features for extendedmode only, find them all here: Using extendedmode Be warned that extendedmode is in ALPHA stages and is not ready for production use.

To do this simply add shared_script '@extendedmode/imports.lua' to your fxmanifest.lua. ExM.Game.PlayAnim ExM.Game.PlayAnim(animDict, animName, upperbodyOnly, duration) This function is a quick and easy way to play any animation you want without having to request animation dictionaries or specify a heap of parameters. Parameters Argument Data Type Optional Default Value Description animDict string No - The animation dictionary animName string No - The animation in the dictionary to play upperbodyOnly boolean Yes false If you want the animation to only affect the upperbody duration integer Yes -1 (full animation) Duration in ms you want the animation to run for Example ExM.Game.PlayAnim( mini@sprunk , plyr_buy_drink_pt1 , false, 1500) ExM.Game.CreatePed ExM.Game.CreatePed(pedModel, pedCoords, isNetworked, pedType) This function is a quick and easy way to create a ped without having to request models or anything, you can choose whether or not to store the ped in a variable or not. Parameters Argument Data Type Optional Default Value Description pedModel hash No - The model of the ped you want to spawn pedCoords vector No - You can use a vector3 or vector4 here, if only using a vector3 the heading will default to 0.0 isNetworked boolean Yes false If you want the ped to be networked or not pedType integer Yes 4 (PED_TYPE_CIVMALE) The type of ped you want to use.
